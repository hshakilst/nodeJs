# Experimental Codebase

This repository contains only my **exercises** and **experimental** codes when learning NodeJs. These projects are **obsolete** and  riddled with **bugs** and **security issues**. Also these works **don't represent** as my **portfolio**. Therefore this repository has now been **archived**.

> **My recent work is [ERPSORS](https://erpsors.vercel.app/) which is still in beta version. Anyone kind enough for finding out bugs is welcome to do so. Join me on ERPSORS's [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/83rzbMfftk).**

### Thank you :)
